# This is code to analyze brain activity measurements that were aquired by microscopes or electrical recordings. 

**Please see "code to load data and make masks/extract_2p_and_patch_data_egg.m" as starting point. This is where neuronal recordings are loaded for analysis and visualization.
**
Please see Nuclino 2photon-> Typical workflow for egg-laying to get an idea of the workflow prior to running any code. [currently my Nuclino protcols are private, sorry]

Will update this section at some point!
