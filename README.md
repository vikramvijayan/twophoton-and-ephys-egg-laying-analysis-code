#  twophoton-and-ephys-egg-laying-analysis-code

This is code to analyze brain activity measurements that were aquired by microscopes or electrical recordings. 

**Typical use would be to start at "code to load data and make masks/extract_2p_and_patch_data_egg.m". This is where neuronal recordings are loaded for analysis and visualization.**

Please see Nuclino 2photon-> Typical workflow for egg-laying to get an idea of the workflow prior to running any code. [currently my Nuclino protcols are private, sorry]

Will update this section at some point!
